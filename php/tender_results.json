No change, including any voluntary\r\n        increase or decrease, in the prices or substance of the Tender shall be sought, offered, or permitted\r\n        except to confirm the correction of arithmetic errors discovered by the Procuring Entity in the\r\n        Evaluation of the Tenders, in accordance with ITT 30.\r\n\r\n        If a Tenderer does not provide clarifications of its Tender by the date and time set in the\r\n        Procuring Entity's request for clarification, its Tender may be rejected.\r\n\r\n27.

A substantially responsive Tender is one that meets the requirements of the tendering document\r\n        without material deviation, reservation, or omission. A material deviation, reservation, or omission is\r\n        one that:\r\n\r\n        a) if accepted, would:\r\n\r\n               i) affect in any substantial way the scope, quality, or performance of the Goods and Related\r\n                     Services specified in the Contract; or\r\n\r\n               ii) limit in any substantial way, inconsistent with the tendering document, the Procuring\r\n                     Entity's rights or the Tenderer obligations under the Contract; or\r\n\r\n        b) if rectified, would unfairly affect the competitive position of other Tenderers presenting\r\n               substantially responsive Tenders.\r\n\r\n28.2 The Procuring Entity shall examine the technical aspects of the Tender submitted in accordance\r\n        with ITT 15 and ITT 16, in particular, to confirm that all requirements of Section VII, Schedule of\r\n        Requirements have been met without any material deviation or reservation, or omission.\r\n\r\n28.3 If a Tender is not substantially responsive to the requirements of tendering document, it shall be\r\n        rejected by the Procuring Entity and may not subsequently be made responsive by correction of the\r\n        material deviation, reservation, or omission.\r\n\r\n29. Non-conformities, Errors and Omissions\r\n\r\n29.1 Provided that a Tender is substantially responsive, the Procuring Entity may waive any non-\r\n        conformities in the Tender.\r\n\r\n29.2 Provided that a Tender is substantially responsive, the Procuring Entity may request that the\r\n        Tenderer submit the necessary information or documentation, within a reasonable period of time, to\r\n        rectify nonmaterial non- conformities or omissions in the Tender related to documentation\r\n        requirements. Such omission shall not be related to any aspect of the price of the Tender. Failure\r\n        of the Tenderer to comply with the request may result in the rejection of its Tender.\r\n\r\n29.3 Provided that a Tender is substantially responsive, the Procuring Entity shall rectify quantifiable\r\n        nonmaterial non-conformities related to the Tender Price. To this effect, the Tender Price shall be\r\n        adjusted, for comparison purposes only, to reflect the price of a missing or non-conforming item or\r\n        component in the manner specified in the TDS. The adjustment shall be based on the average\r\n        price of the item or component as quoted in other substantially responsive Tenders. If the price of\r\n        the item or component cannot be derived from the price of other substantially responsive Tenders,\r\n        the Procuring Entity shall use its best estimate.\r\n\r\n30.

Margin of Preference and Reservations\r\n\r\n32.1 A margin of preference may be allowed on locally manufactured goods only when the contract is\r\n        open to international tendering, where the tender is likely to attract foreign goods and where the\r\n        contract exceeds the threshold specified in the Regulations.\r\n\r\n32.2 For purposes of granting a margin of preference on locally manufactured goods under international\r\n        competitive tendering, a procuring entity shall not subject the items listed below to international\r\n        tender and hence no margin of preference shall be allowed.

No tender shall be reserved to more than one group. If not so stated in the\r\n        Tender documents, the invitation to tender will be open to all interested tenderers.\r\n\r\n33. Evaluation of Tenders\r\n\r\n33.1 The Procuring Entity shall use the criteria and methodologies listed in this ITT and Section III,\r\n        Evaluation and Qualification criteria. No other evaluation criteria or methodologies shall be permitted.\r\n        By applying the criteria and methodologies, the Procuring Entity shall determine the Lowest\r\n        Evaluated Tender. This is the Tender of the Tenderer that meets the qualification criteria and\r\n        whose Tender has been determined to be:\r\n\r\n        a) substantially responsive to the tender documents; and\r\n\r\n        b) the lowest evaluated price.\r\n\r\n33.2 Price evaluation will be done for Items or Lots (contracts), as specified in the TDS; and the\r\n        Tender Price as quoted in accordance with ITT 14. To evaluate a Tender, the Procuring Entity\r\n        shall consider the following:\r\n        a) price adjustment due to unconditional discounts offered in accordance with ITT 13.4;\r\n        b) converting the amount resulting from applying (a) and (b) above, if relevant, to a single\r\n               currency in accordance with ITT 31;\r\n        c) price adjustment due to quantifiable nonmaterial non-conformities in accordance with ITT 29.3;\r\n               and\r\n        d) any additional evaluation factors specified in the TDS and Section III, Evaluation and\r\n               Qualification Criteria.\r\n\r\n33.3 The estimated effect of the price adjustment provisions of the Conditions of Contract, applied over\r\n        the period of execution of the Contract, shall not be considered in Tender evaluation.\r\n\r\n33.4 Where the tender involves multiple lots or contracts, the tenderer will be allowed to tender for one\r\n        or more lots (contracts). Each lot or contract will be evaluated in accordance with ITT 33.2.

The Procuring Entity shall prepare\r\n       the detailed TS consider that:\r\n\r\n       i) The TS constitute the benchmarks against which the Procuring Entity will verify the\r\n               technical responsiveness of Tenders and subsequently evaluate the Tenders. Therefore, well-\r\n               defined TS will facilitate preparation of responsive Tenders by tenderers, as well as\r\n               examination, evaluation, and comparison of the Tenders by the Procuring Entity.\r\n\r\n       ii) The TS shall require that all goods and materials to be incorporated in the goods be new,\r\n               unused, and of the most recent or current models, and that they incorporate all recent\r\n               improvements in design and materials, unless provided for otherwise in the contract.\r\n\r\n       iii) The TS shall make use of best practices. Samples of specifications from successful similar\r\n               procurements in the same country or sector may provide a sound basis for drafting the TS.\r\n\r\n       iv) The PPRA encourages the use of metric units.\r\n\r\n       v) Standardizing technical specifications may be advantageous, depending on the complexity of\r\n               the goods and the repetitiveness of the type of procurement. Technical Specifications should\r\n               be broad enough to avoid restrictions on workmanship, materials, and equipment commonly\r\n               used in manufacturing similar kinds of goods.\r\n\r\n       vi) Standards for equipment, materials, and workmanship specified in the Tendering document\r\n               shall not be restrictive.
